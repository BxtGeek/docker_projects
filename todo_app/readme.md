# ðŸ“‹ Go Todo List Web Application

## Overview

A lightweight, responsive web-based todo list application built with Go and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to add, manage, and track their tasks with an intuitive interface.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Add new tasks with a single click
- âœ… Mark tasks as complete
- ðŸ“… Automatic date tracking for each task
- ðŸŽ¨ Responsive and modern user interface
- ðŸ”’ Concurrent-safe task management

## Application Workflow

1. **Task Addition**
   - Enter a task in the input field
   - Click the "+" button to add the task
   - Task is automatically timestamped with the current date

2. **Task Management**
   - View all tasks in a clean, organized list
   - Checkbox next to each task for marking completion
   - Completed tasks are:
     * Visually crossed out
     * Moved to the bottom of the task list

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional)
- Go 1.21+ (for local development)

## Running the Application

### Docker Deployment

#### Single-Stage Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN go build -o todo-list

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./todo-list"]
```

#### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o todo-list

# Production Stage
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/todo-list .
COPY --from=builder /app/index.html .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./todo-list"]
```
